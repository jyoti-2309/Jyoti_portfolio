üåê Interactive Digital Portfolio (3D Skills Graph)
üåü Project Overview
# This is a modern, personalized portfolio website designed to present my skills and projects in a highly engaging and interactive manner. It moves beyond the limitations of a traditional static resume by incorporating dynamic elements, a high-contrast dark UI, and a unique Interactive 3D Bar Graph to visualize technical proficiency.
# The portfolio is built as a responsive, single-page application (SPA) focused on performance and seamless user experience across all devices.

‚ú® Unique Features
# Interactive 3D Skills Graph: Utilizes Three.js to render a 3D bar chart that visualizes technical proficiency. Users can drag and rotate the graph for a unique, engaging exploration of my skills.
# Modern UI/UX: Features a professional, dark theme built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean aesthetic and smooth transitions between sections.
# Dual Credential Links: In the Certificates section, a clear separation is made between the primary "View Credential" (Indigo) link and the secondary "View Certificate" (Teal) document link for improved clarity.
# Full Responsiveness: Designed using a mobile-first approach to ensure optimal viewing on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
